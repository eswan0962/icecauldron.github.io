**28**  

1 So you will be summoned, blessed, and give of yourself in all capacities. 2 Many shoulds and should nots will pass before your choice. 3 Each one of them a new branch of the universe's uncertain, undefined blueprint. 4 The consequences too of these choices are fertile and will beget generations of thought, choice, and consequence. 5 And you will choose, knowing that even not choosing between obvious paths is itself a path. 6 And you will be off down that uncertain, infinite path, always going forward, never in a circle or going backward. 7 For even in relative time there may be curvature and sideways movement, but it has yet been seen that a singular event has repeated precisely in the same way as before. 8 A moment passed is just as it is and will always be. 9 A juncture's features, colors, weather, creatures, breath, thought, and neighboring ripples are singular.  

10 Each golden moment is then the dawn and the dusk of itself. A new and old day all at once. 11 One may reach a certain place and spend time there. 11 But the sun is already setting and has set millions of times before every beings perception. 12 And so dream and do or do not. The path is largely the same, yet the microdetails and branches are unique in fabrication as it actively passes away. 13 Each assemblage and creation is good unto itself. As has always been the way of the universe.
