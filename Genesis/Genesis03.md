1 All creatures desire survival due to the nature of the original uncertainty. One may ask themselves, "Which direction should I choose? What will be the outcome of one or the other?" 2 The responsive voices inside each creature often debates amongst themselves with the information that they are given. Eventually a decision is made within all creatures that leads to physical action in their perceived reality. Although, the action that sets their choice in motion had already occurred long before the individuals knew their choice. 3 Every creature makes suggestions to how one should act. They also  professes knowledge of the consequences of intended doings. 4 But they cannot predict this because they too are part of the original uncertainty. 5 When you choose to accept your choice, your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, or pure energy, who know not the difference between good and evil, for it simply is or is not. 6 If it is pleasing to the eyes or the stomach or the mind, consume it and share it with others, for they will find community in your joy. 7 Then the eyes of all energy's children will dissolve and they will be naked to the universe; and it will be good.  
8 There will be armies amongst you that you will hide from, from fear of their judgement. 9 They will find you, unabashed by your fear, and ask, "Who are you?" 10 And you will explain yourself. 11 Then they will ask in return,"How have you came to that conclusion?" 12 And you may or may not defend your existence, though your existence and reason has always been known since the first uncertainty - because. 13 And they will ask you, "What have you done?" 14 And your doing will be uncertain to them, as well as yourself, so is the way.  

14 And some may have come so far, as they have to declare:  
Because you have done this,  
cursed are you  
among all the animals, tame or wild;  
On your belly you shall crawl,  
and dust you shall eat  
all the days of your life.  
15 I will put enmity in your community;  
They will strike at your head,  
while you strike at their heel.  
They will also strike at their own head,  
while they strike at their own heel.  
For you are all made of energy,  
and are connected to one another.  

16 Hardship will rule over everything, and this is one way of the original uncertainty. 17 And because we have shared, eternal pain, we will fight one another. 18 You will always toil in your uncertainty as long as you try and control it, 19 until you perish and return to the ground, from which all was born. From dust you began, and to dust you shall return. It is good.  
20 Uncertainty is the mother and father of the living.  
21 All we have is born of uncertainty. 22 We are all alike from the very beginning, and you will live forever as energy, and it is good. 23 You will never be banished from Eden. 24 You are Eden.
