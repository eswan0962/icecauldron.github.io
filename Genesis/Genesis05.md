1 This is the book of the geneology of You. From the moment that energy was created You were made in the likeness of all of energy's enterprise. 2 (09/15/2021) All is changeable, adaptable, and perishable. 3 You will live and then you may transform into something of a similar likeness, a child perhaps. 4 You will live and then die to become something else of a more abstract structure, yet in essence, still a similar likeness. 5 And all that came before you will be an evolution leading to you. 6 And all that comes after you will learn from your structure. 7 This form of yours will die, but the energy of you will not be lost. 8 Energy can neither be created nor destroyed.
