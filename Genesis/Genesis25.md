**25**

1 In life and in death you will have many loves. 2 Unto you many children will be born. 3 Some of them are to be born of thoughts and ideas and others born of your body and the bodies around you. 4 All things around you are your kin. 5 At the end of your days you will give them everything you own including your thoughts, ideas, and bodily treasures. 6 And even before your life cycle has ended will you have gifted those whom you have never met nor beheld.  

7 You will live to an age not yet conceived, and then your energy will pass on and be reanimated in another form. 8 All will take their last breath and die in a cosmic blink, thereby continuing the pattern of their ancestors and all who came before them. 9 You will rest in the ground, or the sky, or the sea, but you will not stay there. 10 For the universe's structures evolve, grow, change, die away, and move forth, on repeat. 11 At the end of your life, you and all around you will be blessed by all you have created and set forth.  

12 There are intrinsic, and so far "unchanging" laws of our universe and these will be _some_ of the names of your and my descendents - Archimedes' principle, Pascal's law, Ohm's law, Huygen's Principle, Newton's first, second, and third law of motion, Newton's law of gravitation, the law of inertia, Coulomb's law, Hook's law, Bernoulli's priciple, Boyle's law, the law of conservation of energy, the law of conservation of momentum, and so on.  

13 Everything that prevails around us is derived and proven through empirical observations. 14 These observations are built on top of years of repeated experimentation and replication.  15 And within yourself and all around you these laws act according to their nature.

14 As within the universe, so in your womb;  
all peoples and acts will emerge from your body.  
one people or act will be as good as any other;  
and they will immigrate into indiscriminance.
