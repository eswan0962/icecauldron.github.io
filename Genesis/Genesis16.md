**16**  

1 When two or more of a given species come together, they will be inevitably connected by networks of patterns within themselves and all that surrounds them. 2 The gifts of one pairing or group is as unique and novel as any other pairing. 3 The crops of one relationship are not comparible to that of another, even though the micro- and macro-patterns of all energy can be similar and regular. 4 One may ask themselves why one pairing is or was not fruitful, and an individual in that party may reach out for another pairing, finding too much imperfection in the first. 5 And one may feel sure of the next pairing. But they will soon find that the apparent defects in any being seem too innumerable to be reconciled. They forget, however, that they are already perfect and good and defectless. As are those they are and have been paired with, according to all that has come before them.  
6 You will be shunned for your openness. You will bear fruit from your bosom and will be despised for your gifts. And you too may receive gifts from someone and scorn them in return. And some may expect a result from their gifts and be unhappy with what you give back. 7 This shame will make you flee into the wilderness. And you may ask yourself how you got so lost and where are you going? 8 And you need only look to the wilderness for its quiet answer. 9 Forward. 10 As you take a breath, a step, a bend, a glance, you are multiplying your descendants so that they will be too many to count.  

11 You will always be with child and death,  
bearing all that is in you,  
and you shall name all you hear,  
And call it your suffering.  
12 Your hand may choose to be against everything,  
and everything rages against you,  
and you will dwell in defiance of all that is good in you.  

13 But if you step up to the river and look down to see yourself plainly:  
14 You will may instead choose to be for everything,  
and everything will be for you,  
and you will dwell in harmony for the all the dark and light inside you.
