**11** (09/28/2021)  
1 The whole universe has always had one language and one speech. 2 It is only when networks divided, split off, and expanded, stretching over billions of fathoms of space and millenia, did a conscious perception of difference form. Structures on top of structures eventually hid the first syntax. 3 From one infinitesimal point to another, there has been continuous building and restructuring and growth and change. This uncertainty has built our homes on this earth and in our minds. 4 Without prompting, energy, which birthed the elements of the universe, built Eden, which we dwell in and contribute to every part of.  

(10/05/2021) 5 You have and will contribute to the buildings of cities, and your children will see the results of your work. 6 And all things, despite their differences, will work together to build these cities - they will find a common way to communicate. And nothing you conceive for this city is impossible. 7 Come, let us not quarrel and confuse one another over subtle differences in our speech and movement. 8 Let not our scattering over every migrating surface of the earth keep us from loving and working together in building this nameless city. 9 For we are not singularly building a city, or planet, or galaxy, or universe, but instead a vast collection of connectivity and change.
