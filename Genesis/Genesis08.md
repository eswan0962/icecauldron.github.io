1 Every living thing is with you, breathing, existing, moving, connecting. 2 The plants understand inevidible change and rebirth.  The frogs understand inevidible change and rebirth.  The bees understand inevidible change and rebirth.  The birds understand inevidible change and rebirth.  The fish understand inevidible change and rebirth.  Man understand inevidible change and rebirth. 3 Before your memory, you were within something else, someone else. They held a life, much like your own. They smiled. And cried. 4 And bled, and before that, the same - again. 4 The mountain you may find within yourself, should you look far enough is monumentous. And the mountain that you are building, is monumentous. 5 It will be passed on every moment. 6 Everything in the universe is made up of matter and energy. 7 It can be transferred, and converted in form, but neither created nor destroyed any more than ever has been.
