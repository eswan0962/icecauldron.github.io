**29**  

1 No matter where a being goes, whether the east or west, they will not be able to escape the desires of themselves or those of others. 2 One may walk, with desires abounding, aimed in all directions, and the confluence of any two or more wants may and will be like tumultuous rivers meeting one another. 3 At first, crashing and churning, and then a stasis will be found further down the river, where a new river will spawn from the old. 4 And even so, that river will converge on another or break. 5 Again and again. 6 The uncertainty surrounding want and pursuit and keeping and stability are all constantly changing features of the universe. 7 A thing or want can only last for so long in a singular shape, for it ages and shifts, like all else. 8 A quest may be undertaken and that pursuit may be set upon, but the plans and even initial destination is uncertain. 9 All that is held onto is eventually transfigured, which is a sort of death and rebirth and is good. 10 Even beneath your seemingly stable feet, the earth moves at 460 meters per second, changes distance from the sun every moment, and stars are being born from unbelievable turbulance found deep within dense clouds of gas and dust of former stars. 11 There is such freedom in knowing that whatever "is" will never last. 12 But there is also so much pain and agony to be doled out and experienced. 13 Yet. 14 Yet, only here you will find ardor.
