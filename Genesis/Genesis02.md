1 This energy within you is the heavens and is part of the earth and original energy of the universe. 2 And so this is how all was made. 3 And all of it is structured, and random, everchanging, and good.  
4 There are generations and generations of creation and death and creation, 5 and every plant and creature has come and gone in its time. 6 Rivers have roved, matured and rejuvenated the land and eventually become one with the ocean. 7 On earth, ancestral vertebrates were born in the ocean. 8 From the before time, during the initial violence of this world - meteorite bombardment, magma oceans, and planetary catastrophy, energy had already created Eden. 9 This world is filled with gardens with all kinds of beautiful trees and fruits. Some of these trees bear fruit that man may eat and others provide food for other creatures. These gifts are marks of uncertainty and adaptation and change.  
10 Out of this quasi-spherical Eden, rivers, born from the veins of mountains and the condensed matter in the ocean and sky, erode the banks of the shifting Earth, transport sediment to the opposite side of the world, and continue the legacy of change from the original uncertainty. 11 The first rivers of Earth have given themselves to uncertainty and are unknown and unnamed, but their presence lingers in the Nile, Colorado, Meuse, Susquehanna, Tigris, and Euphrates rivers. 12 The rocks of the earth hold elements that were formed from the original uncertainty; gold, silver, and onyx. 13 The rivers of all lands, now Ethiopia, and Assyria, the Americas, Siberia, the Steppe, and the Indonesian coast, are good and are part of Eden. 15 Uncertainty is part of man, and we are a part of Eden. 16 Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, 17 but there are actions and consequences that will come to pass with each choice, and it is good.  
18 Man has never been alone. 19 Every beast of the field, every fowl of the air, every water breather, and every human is connected to one another through the original energy, and it is good. 20 These creatures of structure and connection are nameless, for each one is a a new cycle of all that came before it. 21 Each creature adapts in the next rhythm of uncertainty and changes form again and again. Anew. 22 All that is in man - elements, atoms, and cells, is made of the original energy, as are all the creatures, trees, rocks, and sun. 23 All of these are of one another, electron to electron, proton to proton: they are called energy since they are of the same origin. 24 They are of one universal flesh. 25 Everything is naked, and fragile, and not to be shameful, for it is all good.
