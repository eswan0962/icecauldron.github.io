**17**  

1 You will not reach the end of your life here, at ninety years, or perhaps tomorrow, but you will change and you will not be known in the way you are today, but you will be perfect. 2 And the covenant that was made between you and the universe will continue, and you will be multiplied exceedingly forever. 3 You will rise and you do now and have done since the first uncertainty. Then you will fall in the dirt without effort - like breathing. 4 Behold, again, we establish covenant with ourselves and each other with the knowledge that everything on the earth shall die even if you be the creator of many things. 5 you will no longer be named in a language you speak. 6 Yet, even in your decay, you will be fruitful as food, companion, neighbor, and home. 7 Across time and space, we establish another covenant with all that we touch, and the seed of you in the next generation. 8 You will be given gifts in lands wherein you are a stanger and for an everlastingly finite time you will be a god. 9
