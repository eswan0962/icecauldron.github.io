**21**

1 If spirits or conscious sentiments be whispering into your ear, do not push their heedings away, for they will follow you and wait. 2 These creations will be born in time and will be just as raw as the time before. 3 You will call your wound by some names, but it will have many others unknown to you. 4 You will try and circumcise your suffering while it is young. 5 You will live one hundred years cutting at yourself and nary will it be wholly gone. 6 You will laugh at it to make it seem to be a tiny molecule in your vastness, even given its inevidable multiplicative nature. 7 In your old age, you will bare the same suffering, but treat it as a foe and not a friend, who has been with you longer than you've been counting the days of your healing.  

8 Even when unwatched, the innocent will grow, and wean itself on other demonstrative feasts.
